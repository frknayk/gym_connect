# AlphaGo Zero Minimal Example


## Description
The RL designer aims to keep your RL project organized with a simple UI

## Getting Started with UI Mode

- Demonstration of UI is below : main page, training page and inference page

![alt text](images/all_pages.png)

- Training process : 
   1. Do x

- Inference process :
   1. DO x


## Installation
1. Clone the project via command below
   - ``` git clone https://github.com/frknayk/Reinforcement-Learning-Designer.git ```

2. Install necessary packages of the project
   - ```pip3 install requirements.txt``` 
   
## LIMITATIONS
For now the RL designer only supports DQN and DDQN algorithms from value based methods. But in the near future
I will re-integrate dynamic programming methods, cross entropy methods and policy methods.



## Prerequisites
   1. pytorch 
   2. numpy
   4. tensorboard
   5. tensorboardX
